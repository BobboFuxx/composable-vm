# Composable Virtual Machine (CVM)

The Composable Virtual Machine (CVM) is language and execution runtime for cross-chain program execution and intents settlement in [MANTIS](https://docs.composable.finance/technology/mantis). The CVM is an orchestration language on top of standards for cross-chain communication, specifically over IBC.

### Math help

Need to model formulas of Order Books, CoWs, Liquid Staking, Transfers(rate limiter+escrow+free liquidity) protocols hope fully as convex functions. For example, Order Book can be modelled as as piecewise linear approximation.

Also model of Cluster search to account for high fees, so that each chain is OR solution, and these chains connected by IR.

Metaheuriscs way to find inner oracles (mix of ML and CS).

Experience on statistics, OR, data science, CS, ML, algebraic geometry, graphs, topology.
