# Global Lookup Table

Accounts, connections and assets abstractions registry.

Configuration stored on each routeable chain.


Naming inspired by https://solana.com/docs/advanced/lookup-tables .  Unlike registry, which usually in native identifiers, it also stores mapping for some global indexes to local native names.
